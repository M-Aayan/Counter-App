# Counter-App
A Counter App in JavaScript is a simple beginner-friendly web application that demonstrates core concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and variables. It typically displays a number (starting at 0) and includes buttons to:

Increment (+): Increase the count by 1.
Decrement (-): Decrease the count by 1.
Reset: Set the count back to 0.

It's built using HTML (for structure), CSS (for styling), and JavaScript (for interactivity). This project is great for learning how to update the page dynamically without reloading.
How It Works

A variable (e.g., let count = 0;) tracks the current value.
Buttons trigger event listeners (e.g., addEventListener('click', ...)).
On click, the variable is updated (count++ or count--), and the displayed number is refreshed using textContent or innerText.
